 <h1>Chapter 1</h1>   

 <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</p>

 <p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>

<p>“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”</p>

<p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</p>

<p>“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bennet made no answer.</p>
